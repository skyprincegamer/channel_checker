# Channel Checker

Random project I made for college. Runs in the background and has 
the ability to 'read' the Youtube Channel Name of the Youtube video the user is currently watching.
Can also 'read' the URL of a webpage the user has currently open on their device. 
#### Known Issues
 - Cannot detect the channel name if the user is subscribed to the channel being currently watched.
